## Community roles

I co-organized [Fab:UNIverse](fab-universe.de) multiple times and maintain its website (it's a conference for Fab Lab managers at universities). I've also organized a lot of different events, temporary (Maker)spaces and meetups such as the annual World Usability Day Siegen. 

I have been an elected member of different bodies of (self)-governance such as the Senate commission on Strategic University Development at Uni Siegen and head of the student representatives ("Fachschaftsräte") at Uni Duisburg-Essen and at Uni Siegen respectively.

As a researcher, I was reviewer/chair for conferences and journals like [CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi/proceedings), [JCSCW](https://www.springer.com/journal/10606), [C&T](https://dl.acm.org/conference/c-n-t) or [M&C](https://mensch-und-computer.de/).
