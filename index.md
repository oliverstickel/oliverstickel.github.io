## Experience

`2020-today`
**Lab Manager at Bochum Makerspace** - I manage two sub-labs (IT and plastics fabrication) and I'm involved in the general management of [RUB-Makerspace](https://makerspace.rub.de), a 2000sqm innovation space with a team of 15 people. *Ruhr-Universität Bochum*, Germany.

## Projects and funding

`2019-2022`
**SMAPS** [- the center for smart production systems](https://www.smaps.org/) - was a research-infrastructure project on additive fabrication and smart systems for industrial tooling (mainly forming processes). I was part of the proposal team and briefly involved in the ramp-up phase (mainly procurement).  
*European EFRE-fund (EFRE.NRW), Germany, about 3m€* 

`2017-2020`
**FAB 101** [was a joint research project](https://fab101.de) of four German universities on Fab Labs and digital fabrication in academic. It focused on cooperation, tools, education and infrastructure. I developed the core idea for the project, led the proposal and was overall project manager as well as part of the operative team.  
*Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, about 1.2m€.* 

`2016-2018`
**YALLAH** - "You All Are Hackers" [was a student exchange project](https://yallah.exchange/). Students from Palestine and Germany visited each other for multiple stays and worked on socio-economical issues using "maker-methods". I had the project idea after my own visits to Palestine as a student, led the proposal and helped to recruit and set up the staff who took over the project.  
*German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), about 225.000€.*

`2016-2018`
**ZEIT.RAUM Siegen** was a regional project to build a 3D-printed, interactive city model and a [regional Wiki](https://wiki.zeitraum-siegen.de/) for an installation in a local museum. I coordinated the ideation phase, wrote most of the proposals and was part of the negotiation team. In the project, I built the first prototypes for model and wiki and recruited the project staff.  
*Regional societies, University of Siegen, other sources, about 190.000€.*

`2015-2016`
**Internet-Cafe4Refugees** was a project we set up when Uni Siegen housed hundreds of refugees. We provided tech support, hardware and internet connection together with the local [freifunk.net](https://freifunk.net/) community.   
*Volunteer work, hardware donations and enough local funding for student aids to cover daily opening hours.*

`2013-today`
**Fab Lab Siegen** was *[my baby](https://fablab-siegen.de)* for many years and my first real experience in regards being a founder and the world of fundraising. My old team is still running and growing the Lab and it has become local infrastructure.  
*Calls for student projects, donations, other sources, about 100.000€ in money during the first 2-3 years (later, funding strategies changed). The spaces for the lab were/are co-sponsored by private-public partnerships and there were/are hardware donations as well.*

`2012-2015`
**CUBES** was a research project on community-based innovation in software and usability for small and medium sized enterprises. I was involved as a student, then researcher, then (interim) project manager for the [project reporting and closing](https://www.tib.eu/de/suchen?tx_tibsearch_search%5Baction%5D=download&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bcontroller%5D=Download&tx_tibsearch_search%5Bdocid%5D=TIBKAT%3A872262936&cHash=7d56fa41baf92a721f58064874672f4a#download-mark).  
*Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, about 800.000€.*

## Community roles

I co-organized [Fab:UNIverse](fab-universe.de) multiple times and maintain its website - it's a conference for Fab Lab managers at universities. I've also (co-)organized a lot of different events, temporary (Maker)spaces and meetups such as the Usability Day Siegen (2014-2018). 

I have been an elected member of different bodies of (self)-governance such as the Senate commission on Strategic University Development at Uni Siegen and head of the student representatives ("Fachschaftsräte") at Uni Duisburg-Essen and at Uni Siegen respectively. Occasionally, I've been asked to fill roles in regional and national expert committees (mostly in relation to innovation and community spaces). 

As a researcher, I was reviewer/chair for conferences and journals like [CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi/proceedings), [JCSCW](https://www.springer.com/journal/10606), [C&T](https://dl.acm.org/conference/c-n-t) or [M&C](https://mensch-und-computer.de/). 

## Teaching

I enjoy teaching and learning a lot. At Uni Siegen, I've been responsible for the practical part of the mandatory introduction to Human Computer Interaction for many years - i.e. mentoring up to 40 students per iteration through big, semester-long projects ending in submissions to and wins in national student challenges. Additionally, I've held many different seminars ranging from reading classes on literature about "Making" to very practical seminars on rapid prototyping methods. I've made it a point to try and be open in teaching and have frequently had students from other faculties or external guests in my seminars. 

As a thesis advisor and co-advisor, I have accompanied about 8 Bachelor and Master Students along their paths to graduation. Topics have varied from participatory-design-oriented field investigations to studies about Makerspaces in teacher training to engineering and fabrication of additive tools for industrial processes. Additionally, I've been involved in co-advising state-certified technicians as a pilot project between a university and a technical vocational college. 

Nowadays, I'm less involved in structured, academic teaching but mostly teach and learn whatever is needed to help many different Makerspace community members from (many different) disciplines with their - many different - projects.
