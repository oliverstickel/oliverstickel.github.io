## Experience

`2020-present`
**Lab Manager at Bochum Makerspace** - I manage two sub-labs (IT and plastics fabrication) and I'm involved in the general management of [RUB-Makerspace](https://makerspace.rub.de), a 2000sqm innovation space with a team of 15 people. *Ruhr-Universität Bochum*, Germany.

**Writer, researcher, consultant**. Book project "Handbuch Fab Labs" and consultation work for organizations interested in Maker-/innovation spaces. *Self-employed*, Germany.


`2015 - 2019`
**Researcher, project manager**. After graduating, I stayed at Uni Siegen as a researcher to continue building [Fab Lab Siegen](https://fablab-siegen.de) into a sustainable infrastructure.

I founded [Fab Lab Siegen](https://fablab-siegen.de) and managed it on its journy from a student initiative in a literal storage room on campus outside the city to a wonder- and colorful, open and community-oriented space of about 300sqm filled with people, ideas, tools and machines right in the city center. *University and region of Siegen*, Germany.

`2009 - 2015`
**TA, student researcher**. During my student times, I was a teachin assistant (mostly in HCI), assisted in different research projects (mostly with qualitative field research) and was in IT support/maintenance. *Universities of Siegen and Duisburg-Essen*, Germany.

## Community roles

I co-organized [Fab:UNIverse](fab-universe.de) multiple times and maintain its website (it's a conference for Fab Lab managers at universities). I've also (co-)organized a lot of different events, temporary (Maker)spaces and meetups such as the Usability Day Siegen (2014-2018). 

I have been an elected member of different bodies of (self)-governance such as the Senate commission on Strategic University Development at Uni Siegen and head of the student representatives ("Fachschaftsräte") at Uni Duisburg-Essen and at Uni Siegen respectively. I've also occasionally been asked to fill roles in regional and national expert committees (mostly in relation to innovation and community spaces). 

As a researcher, I was reviewer/chair for conferences and journals like [CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi/proceedings), [JCSCW](https://www.springer.com/journal/10606), [C&T](https://dl.acm.org/conference/c-n-t) or [M&C](https://mensch-und-computer.de/). 

## Projects and funding

`2017-2020`
**FAB 101** <br/> was a joint research project of four German universities on Fab Labs digital fabrication in academic education. I developed the core idea for the project, led the proposal and was overall project manager as well as part of the operative team. *Federal Ministry of Education and Research*, Germany, about 1.2m €. 

`2016-2018`
**YALLAH** - or "You All Are Hackers" [was a student exchange project](https://yallah.exchange/). Students from Palestine and Germany visited each other for multiple stays and worked on socio-economical issues using "maker-methods" and working out of Makerspaces. I had the project idea after my own visits to Palestine as a student, led the proposal and helped to recruit and set up the staff who took over the project.  *German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)*, Germany, about 225.000€. <br/>
Description here

`2016-2018`
**ZEIT.RAUM Siegen** was a regional project to build a 3D-printed, interactive city model and a [regional Wiki](https://wiki.zeitraum-siegen.de/) for an installation in a local museum. I coordinated the ideation phase, wrote most of the proposals and was part of the negotiation team. Within the project, I built the first prototypes for model and wiki and recruited the staff who finished the project. *Regional societies, University of Siegen, other sources*, Germany, about 190.000€ <br/>

`2013 - today`
**Fab Lab Siegen** was my "baby" for many years and my first real experience in regards being a founder and the world of fundraising. *Different calls for student projects, donations and other funding sources*, 100.000€ during the first 2-3 years (after that, project funding via research project became dominant).

`2012-2015`
**CUBES**, research project on community-based innovation in software development and usability for small and medium sized enterprises. I was involved as a student, then researcher and, in the end, as (interim) project manager for all aspects of the final reporting and project closing. *Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy*, Germany, about 800.000€. <br/>

## Awards and honors

`2015`
**Best Graduate of the faculty**, University of Siegen, Germany.

`2014`

`2013`
**First Prize** *Student Usability Challenge*, German Informatics Society (GI).



## Teaching

I really enjoy teaching and learning and consider both to be cornerstones of civilization. At Uni Siegen, I've been responsible for the practical part of the mandatory introduction to Human Computer Interaction for many years (including a mentoring up to 40 students per iteration through big, semester-long projects, cumulating in submissions to and wins in national student challenges). I also substituted for a lot of the theoretical lecture parts and reworked the whole lecture material over the time. Additionally, I've held many different elective seminars ranging from reading classes on literature about "Making" to very practical seminars on rapid prototyping methods. I've made it a point to try and be as open and interdisciplinary in teaching as possible and have frequently had students and guests from other faculties and from outside the university in my seminars. 

As a thesis advisor and co-advisor, I have accompanied about 10 Bachelor and Master Students along their paths to graduation. Topics have varied from participatory-design-oriented field investigations to studies about Makerspaces in teacher training to engineering and fabrication of additive tools for industrial processes. Additionally, I've been involved in co-advising state-certified technicians as a pilot project between a university and a technical (vocational) college. 

Nowadays, I'm less involved in structured, academic teaching but mostly teach (and learn) whatever is needed to help many different Makerspace users form many different disciplines with their (many different) projects.
