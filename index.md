## Community involvement

ToDo

I co-hosted the Fab:UNIverse conference (a gathering of Fab Lab managers in German academia) multiple times and maintain the conference's web presence. I've also organized a lot of different workshops, temporary / mobile Makerspaces as well as other meetups such as the annual World Usability Day Siegen. 

In the past, I have been an elected member of multiple bodies of academic self-governance such as the Senate commission on Strategic University Development at Uni Siegen as well as head of the student representatives ("Fachschaftsr채te") during my times as a student at Uni Duisburg-Essen and at Uni Siegen respectively. I have also served as a faculty work safety advisor. 

During my time as a researcher, I was reviewer and/or chair for conferences and journals (e.g. CHI or JCSCW, C&T, M&C).
